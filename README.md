# Java Training

Welcome to the programming training modules for Team 4015!  The goal of this repository is to help the programming team to to learn how to program in Java.  Java is a very extensive language, although programmers will only need to know a few of the main features in order to program the FRC robot.  Throughout this training, you will learn how to write, compile, and run Java programs.  The programming team leaders will also be teaching you how to use GitHub to develop and share your code with the rest of the team!

Feel free to start working on the practice modules in this repository.  Each module can be found in a different folder and numbered starting at 0 in true computer science fashion.  Make sure to write your code on your own branch, as you will not be able to push code to the `master` branch.  It is suggested to use your name as your branch name in order to keep everyone's code organized.  Remember to push your code to GitHub when you make changes!  This will allow others to help you if you get stuck and is also a useful way of sharing ideas.  This is a very important skill for working as a team of programmers!

Good luck, and feel free to reach out to your programming team leaders if you have any questions!
